		<ul>
			<li>Chin tucks: By pulling your chin towards your neck and holding for a few seconds, you can improve your posture and increase strength in your neck muscles.</li>
			<li>Neck Flexion/Extension: Relax your neck muscles until you look straight up or straight down for a few seconds before pulling back to your normal position.</li>
			<li>Isometric neck strengthening: Place your palm on your forehead, and resist flexion of your neck while keeping your head still; hold, and then relax.</li>
